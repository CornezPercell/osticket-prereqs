After setting up a Microsoft Azure account and subscription, create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine with a minimum of 4 vCPUs. A username and password will be needed to log in
on the VM, be sure to create and store the username and password so that the correct information is accessible, as it will be needed to log in using Remote Desktop.

After successfully logging into the VM, open the web browser and go to osticket.com. You will need to download the files to install OS ticket onto the VM.
